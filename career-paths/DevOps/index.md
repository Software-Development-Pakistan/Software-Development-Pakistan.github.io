# DevOps

DevOps is the modern approach in `Agile` to solve the problem of the communication between the `tester`, the `developer`, and the `operations` team. In the software development cycle, the developer is the person that is meant to develop features in code, the tester is meant to make sure all the tests are satisfied and nothing breaks in the development environment. The `operations` has to take care of pushing those new changes into the production environment and to make sure it does not break anything else. This whole cycle mainly comprises of the following main points,

1. Designing (the infrastructure and networking)
2. Observability (implementing Logging, Metrics and Tracing)
3. Automation (CI/CD pipelines, deployments, auto-scaling )

The idea is that developer wants to make changes and push those to the production as soon as possible, also called `early to market`, but doing this in the past has resulted in the Ops person receiving calls at 2 AM in the morning about something critical breaking - no one likes that. The `Ops` person on the other hand wants to strive to maintain as much stability as possible, and always pushing new changes ( increasing the velocity ) leads to breaks - which is undesired.

So the idea has been mainly on focusing on automation in order to make changes as quickly as possible, and finding the way to maintan good velocity as well as stability.

# An Introduction

The modern DevOps consists of automated sets of tests that keep checking if the new changes break anything, it has an automated sense of commands that take in some configuration files, make sense of the changes, and apply those settings to a containzired environment. Usually, you'll find the changes being `deployed` to `containers` that have the complete environment setup for the customer. 

So what is the remaining work? It's to configure `.json`, `.yaml / .yml` files that take in `manifestations` of the `images` that you want to push to production and making sure and note of what changes happen when and what breaks and what's get fixed, most likely through a versioning tool such as `git`. Companies also prefer to use `github`, `gitlab` or `bitbucket` for extra features.

# General

# Getting Started
It is hard to justify what is DevOps or how to implement it in a proper way. You can read about it in [FAQs](#faq). To become an engineer with firm DevOps concepts you have to be a Developer or Operations person at first. Then you pivot into being a DevOps Engineer or Systems Engineer as it is formally called. An extension to DevOps is Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). A complete DevOps person would know one of the technology from each segment mentioned in [Technologies](#technologies).

# People To Follow

# FAQ

### Is DevOps a title (designation or role), a team, a practice or something else?
DevOps is the set of practices and mindset for modern software delivery. It provides highlevel guidelines on automation, continuous improvements, and increasing the end to end value in software development lifecycle. It is not a role in the sense that having a DevOps Engineering with bad practices would not bring any value.

### What is SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)? How is it different from DevOps?
SRE is a term coined by Google. SRE is one of the way to implement DevOps and can be understood as a concrete set of practices based on abstraction defined by DevOps. SRE has terms like Toil, SLIs, SLOs, SLAs, etc which all serve a purpose to improve overall system value. SRE could be a role, a person who implements Site Reliability Engineering practices. 

### What is Platform Engineering? How is it different from DevOps or SRE?
Platform Engineers in old days used to be a bridge between hardware and software. They used to write software (or drivers) for hardware which other Software systems would use as underline platform. Recently Platform Engineering is about creating a standardized set of practices or setting up tools / technologies which other parts of the organisation use. It could be that Cloud environments are used by everyone in IT but managed by Platform Team as a standard. This way then can enforce certain security policies, usage patterns, etc. More details can be found [here](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2020/02/13/setting-the-stage-for-platform-engineering/)
It is the implementation of DevOps and SRE practices and is a proper Role where as DevOps is not a role.

### What is Systems Engineering? How is it different from terms mentioned above?
Systems Engineering is a more formal way of defining the role which manages the infrastructure, standard platforms and DevOps practices. It could be any  combination of DevOps practices, Site Reliability Engineering and/or Platform Engineering. A systems engineer's focus is on improving the overall System rather than developing business features. It is better to name the role as Systems Engineer rather than DevOps engineer.

I'm not sure every ops-employed person would 100% agree with this list. As the author says, 'This list is opinionated.'. However, I think at a minimum it's a good starter list to get a sense of what types of skills individuals in these roles tend to need.
