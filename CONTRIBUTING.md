# Contributing Guidelines

## General guidelines.

Contributions are heavily appreciated. It's the community that makes the group the truly spirited and unique group that it is. As far as the contributing guidelines for this repository, they are as follows:

1. Go ahead and make some edit in a file where you think something additional can be added.
2. Make that into a Pull Request so that the maintainers can review and approve or reject accordingly.
3. Want to start a discussion about something that is missing? Make an issue! If the idea is helpful to everyone, we'll consider adding it into the main master repository.
4. Each section has its own contribute template that needs to be followed.
